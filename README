This is Grub2 but it's edited so it can be used on tablets that doesn't have an "enter" key.
The "volume up" key functions as the "enter" key and the "volume down" functions as the "down" key. 
And after the pointer reaches the end of the list, it goes to the first entry. 
And there is a delay (250ms) after every changing menu entry beacause volume keys originally move cursor too fast
